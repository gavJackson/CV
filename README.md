# Gavin Jackson
 
## TL;DR

> I am a Frontend developer with over 15 years of professional experience. I love writing code and architecting solutions while keeping in mind business objectives and the overall picture.  I have an eye for design and animation from the early part of my career creating customer facing Flash sites and in the last few years I have been building financial single page applications, priding myself on delivering modern, responsive, accessible applications with a focus on UX.  I am extremely productive and consider myself one of the few 10xers out there.
