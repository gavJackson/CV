Group Head of Frontend Development @ Dunstan Thomas

**I am an extremely focused and productive, hands on Head of Frontend Development with nearly 20 years of professional experience. I love writing code and designing solutions and APIs while keeping in mind the business strategy and overall picture.  I have an eye for design and animation from the early part of my career creating customer facing Flash sites for some of the biggest brands in the world.  For the last decade, I have been building financial single page applications, built upon my own JavaScript MVCS framework; which is used to deliver large scale business critical enterprise applications to some of the largest companies in the financial world. I pride myself on delivering modern, responsive, accessible applications with a focus on user experience.**

## Career Summary

After University in 2002, I had a couple of ASP and SQL jobs, but my Frontend career really started in Melbourne, Australia in 2006 while backpacking, working for an advertising agency and then returning home to the UK and becoming a Senior Flash Developer at a creative agency in Bristol. After that, I contracted around Bristol and the South West.  In that time I worked on projects for big clients and household names such as Nike, Mattel, Hertz, Estee Lauder, BP, Intel, Barbie and HotWheels to name a few, and I am proud to say that my work has been seen by millions of users across the world.

In 2011, I joined Digital Keystone, a small financial software company as a contract Flex Developer.  At the time Digital Keystone had a single client and no product, but over the next three years, while helping grow the company, I built the underlying framework and frontend to an award-winning product called Adaptive Portal. In 2015, I was offered a partnership and became Head of Frontend Development and In 2016, we sold Digital Keystone in a multi-million pound merger to Dunstan Thomas, where I stayed on as the Group Head of Frontend Engineering. The frontend framework *Adaptive Portal*, that I built for Digital Keystone was renamed to IntegroCX, and is now the largest product in the suite offered by Dunstan Thomas and what we use to deliver most of our client projects.

In 2020, as a shareholder of Dunstan Thomas, I was once again involved in a major acquisition; and Dunstan Thomas was acquired by Curtis Banks, in another multi-million pound deal, roughly 10 times larger than the Digital Keystone deal.  I continued on as the Group Head of Frontend Engineering.

For a hackathon in 2021, I produced a sales/marketing video introducing ICX https://youtu.be/fvzzL1GTetI

## Current position

As Group Head of Frontend Engineering I still develop and add features to the frontend Integro CX framework on which the majority of our projects are built.  I also mentor and manage a team of 6 Frontend developers with the goal of building a community with resilience, as well as supporting ~20 backend developers working across various projects across the organisation. I encourage innovation and lead by example, taking the longer more complex route of enhancing the core product in a generic way to benefit current and future projects rather than custom-coding a solution for a single project.

As primary architect of the IntegroCX frontend, I design and maintain an API I built from the ground up, my goal is to make using ICX as effortless as possible for the Frontend development teams that consume it.  I believe in making it so "it just works" as the developer expects.  Over the years I have learnt and refined how I do this, good API design is key, but backwards compatibility means compromises also have to be made and this is where documentation and testing really helps. So I wrote a markdown file consuming documentation system that automatically generates live interactive examples from manifest files used to describe the various components of ICX and a hash url, screenshot comparison based battery of end-to-end tests that can be invoked using a command line interface tool.

## Personal projects

Outside of work, I like to dabble in new technology and have a few side projects on the go:

## Personal life

I met my wife Lorraine while travelling in Thailand.  We have two kids, Daisy and Henry and live in Bath, having recently returned from living in Spain for 3 years, on the Costa Blanca. I enjoy spending time with my family, riding my bikes (either road or mountain) and being outdoors as much as possible.  In winters (pre-covid) we ski, and I have recently taken up wild swimming and completed my first Triathlon.
