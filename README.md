Group Head of Frontend Development @ Dunstan Thomas
 
## TL;DR

> I am a Frontend developer with over 15 years of professional experience. I love writing code and designing solutions while keeping in mind business objectives and the overall picture.  I have an eye for design and animation from the early part of my career creating customer facing Flash sites for some of the biggest brands in the world and in the last few years I have been building financial single page applications, priding myself on delivering modern, responsive, accessible applications with a focus on UX.  I am extremely productive and consider myself a 10xer.

## Remote 

I have been working remotely since 2012, attending a few meetings a year around the UK but otherwise working entirely from my home, first in Bristol and now in Spain.  I have no problem with maintaining productivity and have been a disciplined self starter since University, demonstrated by graduating top of my class, way back in 2002. 

## Career Summary

After University I had a couple of ASP and SQL jobs but my frontend career really started in Melbourne, Australia in 2006, working for an advertising agency and then returning home to the UK and becoming a Flash Developer at an Ad agency in Bristol. After that I did was contracting around Bristol and the South West.  In that time I worked on projects for big clients and household names such as Nike, Mattel, Hertz, Estee Lauder, BP, Intel, Barbie and HotWheels to name a few and I am proud to say that my work was seen by millions of users across the world.
  
In 2011 I joined Digital Keystone, a small financial software company as a contract Flex developer.  At the time Digital Keystone had a single client and no product, but over the next three years, while helping grow the company, I built the underlying framework and frontend to an award winning product called Adaptive Portal. In 2015 I was offered a partnershiop and became Head of Frontend development and In 2016 we sold Digital Keystone in a multi-million pound merger, where I am now the Group Head of Frontend Engineering at Dunstan Thomas.

## Current position

As Group Head of Frontend Engineering for Dunstan Thomas I continue to develop the Adaptive Portal framework on which the majority of our projects are built.  I also mentor and manage a team of 3 fulltime frontend developers on top of supporting the 20-30 full stack developers (a mix of contractors and permanent staff members) working across multiple projects across the company. I regularly innovate, while contributing to multiple projects, taking the long or difficult route of enhancing the core product and our toolset in a generic way to benefit current and future projects.

### PooEggCrack

PooEggCrack is a YouTube channel for my kids.  I had a lot of fun coming up with the branding (the name was Daisy's username for Roblox)  and editing their videos, filling them with Memes, sound effects and just general nonsense.

## Personal life

I met my wife Lorraine while travelling in Thailand, we have two kids, Daisy and Henry and we live in a small sea-side town called Javea in Spain, on the Costa Blanca. I enjoy spending time with my family, riding my bikes (either road or mountain) and being outdoors all year round, we go skiing in winters and the rest of the time we are on or near the beach and exploring Spain.  

I have a pretty good life :-)
