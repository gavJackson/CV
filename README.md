I truly believe that the frontend, the thing that users interact with, makes or breaks a product.  Solid, robust and performant frontends show that you are trust worthy and established. Shonky, janky, slow frontends will harm your brand.  Frontends can elevate your users experience beyond your competitors, they should be beautiful but they can also delight through attention to detail, consistency and cool micro interactions.  

## Profile


- I am a Frontend specialist with over 20 years of professional experience.  
- I have been involved in two multi-million pound company exits, both centred around the products I built.  
- Most of my career has been spent in senior, tech lead or head positions where I lead the frontend development of multiple cross-functional, distributed agile teams.  
- I have spent the last 10 years working in FinTech where I have written my own low-code frontend framework Integro CX which has been used to deliver multiple enterprise level wealth management platforms.  
- Before that I spent 6 years working in Advertising creating web experiences for some of the biggest brands in the world.  
- I have a keen eye for design, and I understand how to deliver robust, accessible, performant and delightful user experiences, writing high quality code, whilst being able to understand and influence the business requirements and wider strategy and architecture.

This was a short term contract to build a Flex video player where I was brought in to save the project.

An ex-colleague was running a project that ran into problems and I was brought in to save the project where we built a Flex website for the Jo Malone brand of Estee Lauder. One of my favourite parts of the project was creating a fruit machine style gift box generator where Jo Malone products were seemingly picked at random to build a gift box at a certain value, I had a lot of fun with blurred spinning animations and writing the algorithm to pick the products.
