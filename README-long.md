Group Head of Frontend Development @ Dunstan Thomas
 
## TL;DR

> I am a Frontend developer with over 15 years of professional experience. I love writing code and designing solutions while keeping in mind business objectives and the overall picture.  I have an eye for design and animation from the early part of my career creating customer facing Flash sites for some of the biggest brands in the world and in the last few years I have been building financial single page applications, priding myself on delivering modern, responsive, accessible applications with a focus on UX.  I am extremely productive and consider myself a 10xer.


## Technical skills

Knockout.js / Jasmine / RequireJS / Vue.js / Electron

Adobe PhotoShop / iMovie / Flash / Flex / AS3


## Remote 

I have been working remotely since 2012, attending a few meetings a year around the UK but otherwise working entirely from my home, first in Bristol and now in Spain.  I have no problem with maintaining productivity and have been a disciplined self starter since University, demonstrated by graduating top of my class, way back in 2002. 

## Career Summary

After University I had a couple of ASP and SQL jobs but my frontend career really started in Melbourne, Australia in 2006, working for an advertising agency and then returning home to the UK and becoming a Flash Developer at an Ad agency in Bristol. After that I did was contracting around Bristol and the South West.  In that time I worked on projects for big clients and household names such as Nike, Mattel, Hertz, Estee Lauder, BP, Intel, Barbie and HotWheels to name a few and I am proud to say that my work was seen by millions of users across the world.
  
In 2011 I joined Digital Keystone, a small financial software company as a contract Flex developer.  At the time Digital Keystone had a single client and no product, but over the next three years, while helping grow the company, I built the underlying framework and frontend to an award winning product called Adaptive Portal. In 2015 I was offered a partnershiop and became Head of Frontend development and In 2016 we sold Digital Keystone in a multi-million pound merger, where I am now the Group Head of Frontend Engineering at Dunstan Thomas.

## Current position

As Group Head of Frontend Engineering for Dunstan Thomas I develop the frontend Adaptive Portal framework on which the majority of our projects are built, I mentor and manage a team of 3 frontend developers while also supporting ~20 full stack developers working across various projects across the organisation. I encourage innovation and lead by example, taking the longer more complex route of enhancing the core product in a generic way to benefit current and future projects rather than custom coding a solution for a single project.   

One of my main projects is for Aegon, the UK's largest pension provider where we are replacing their entire Wealth Management Platform.  Each sprint I plan all frontend work, pair program and guide the dev team through their frontend (and sometimes backend) tasks while also liaising with the client, ensuring that their requirements are in a dev ready state for the next sprint.  

I am very motivated and self driven, working on `side-projects` in-between my project responsibilities, some side projects are as a direct result of current project needs, and others are big picture improvements for the entire product suite.  All side projects are my own invention and most of the Adaptive Portal commerical offering is the result of these side projects.  

A recent side project was to completely rewrite all the CSS from the past 6 years, providing a new layered skinning architecture promoting performance and overriding as well as a modern new look to all new projects via a white labelling approach.


### About Adaptive Portal

The Adaptive Portal framework is a framework for delivering dashboard and form based single page applications.  It is a low code framework (in the frontend) driven from the fact that I was a lone frontend developer supporting multiple projects for so many years. This means the frontend is entirely configurable from service responses which describe dashboard layouts and what is on each form and is capable of fine control over client side validation and dynamic rules. Making such a configurable frontend requires a robust and flexible architecture, enabling entire systems to be prototyped and built through configuration and a bit of styling, rather than custom coding, which is reserved for new features and even those are assessed to see if they can be delivered via new configurations or features in the core framework to benefit future projects.



## Annual highlights

**2019**: Looking forward to new challenges....

**2018**: Became Group Head of Frontend Development across the whole Dunstan Thomas group of companies.  Continued to lead the frontend of the Aegon project while also building the core frontend team.  Implemented a new skinning architecture, designing a new look for the Adaptive Portal and implemented new look in two new projects, both delivered on time and exceeding expectations, paving the way forward for future projects.

**2017**: Lead the frontend development to replace the entire platform for Financial Advisers for one of the UK's largest wealth management companies, **Aegon**.  As Head of Frontend Development, I lead, (along with the backend lead) a team of 14 full stack developers using Agile project management methodologies, holding daily stand-ups, planning the frontend sprint work, designing framework compatible solutions, trained and on-boarded new hires, pair programmed complex or difficult concepts, quality checked the code, made sure tasks were completed to my satisfaction and answered any queries, either from the development team, the client or the management team.

**2016**: Was part of a multi-million pound merger, where my stock options were bought out and the primary share holders were able to execute their exit strategies.  This happened when Dunstan Thomas merged (bought) Digital Keystone, meeting out our target valuation three years early.  I made a gentleman's agreement to remain at the company for at least 2 years.  The Adaptive Portal also won the UK Platforms Award for best use of Platform Technology for our work with Aegon.

**2015**: Offered the permanent position of Head of Frontend development in an effort to make Digital Keystone a more realistic proposition to sell in alignment with the partner's exit strategy.  

**2014**: Designed, and built the frontend of the multi award winning Adaptive Portal, while working on client projects, primarily in financial services.  The Adaptive Portal is a framework for rendering lazy loaded Apps onto a dashboard and for rendering dynamic complex forms, either as single forms or in complex multi screen workflow (which are used quite a bit in finance).  Apps can show high level statistical summaries in the form of numbers or charts and can be expanded to drill down into more detail, typically datagrids or charts, although any Apps are possible (I built a couple of 3D apps, using three.js to render web gl 3D models, one of the planet (complete with lens flare) and a prototype for a Health company, showing a 3D wire-frame of the human body onto which can be manipulated to show where symptoms are occurring).  Adaptive Portal also won the Platforum `best in show` award.

**2013**: Built the frontend of QuickPark which used an early build of the Adaptive Portal to render an SVG map showing available parking bays around various South African cities, the project was designed to work on tablets aad phones.

**2012**: When Digital Keystone decided to move away from Flash as a technology I was tasked with choosing the frontend tech stack and began work on the early prototypes of the Adaptive Portal as the company strategy shifted from purely an on-site programming services company to one that builds and ships it own product, configuring that product for clients.

**2011**: Joined Digital Keystone as a contract Flex developer to build and maintain wealth management applications for **Novia Financial** and **Aegon**.

**2010**: Worked on the **Jo Malone** website for **Estee Lauder** as a Flex developer and did a number of other Flash/Flex contracts for clients ranging from **Fisher Price** to **Drink Aware**.

**2009**: In my role as Technical Lead at Oakwood DC I headed up a team of 8 Flash developers to deliver a Â£300k project for **Radica** the electronics division for **Mattel US**, we delivered the project on time and on budget.

**2007 - 2008**: As Senior Flash Developer at Oakwood DC I worked on a number of Flash projects for globally recognised brands such as **Barbie**, **Hotwheels**, **Disney's Cars**, **Scrabble** and **The Simposons**.

**2006**: Worked in Australia for Publicis Mojo as a web developer for clients such as **Nike**, **Hertz**, **HP** and the **Victorian Government**.  A highlight was working on the **Nike Football** website for World Cup 2006 and promotions for Australia's big game against Brazil where they dared that to believe that history would not repeat itself (but, it did).

**2002 - 2005**: Graduated top of my class from De Montfort University in Leicester in 2002 with a first class degree with honours in Multimedia Computing and was also **awarded the best student prize for finishing top of my class**.  My first few years out of university I worked as a Web Developer in Reading writing ASP and ASP.NET web and windows applications and services before going travelling for 20 months.

## Personal life

I grew up in Hazlemere, near High Wycombe in Buckingshire, my Dad is English and my Mum is from Thailand. 

I met my wife Lorraine while travelling in Thailand, we have two kids, Daisy and Henry and we live in a small sea-side town called Javea in Spain, on the Costa Blanca. I enjoy spending time with my family, riding my bikes (either road or mountain) and being outdoors all year round, we go skiing in winters and the rest of the time we are on or near the beach and exploring Spain.  

I have a pretty good life :-)
