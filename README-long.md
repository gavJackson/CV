## Career Summary

After University in 2002, I had a couple of ASP and SQL jobs, but my Frontend career really started in Melbourne, Australia in 2006 while backpacking, working for an advertising agency and then returning home to the UK and becoming a Senior Flash Developer at a creative agency in Bristol. After that, I contracted around Bristol and the South West.  In that time I worked on projects for big clients and household names such as Nike, Mattel, Hertz, Estee Lauder, BP, Intel, Barbie and HotWheels to name a few, and I am proud to say that my work has been seen by millions of users across the world.

In 2011, I joined Digital Keystone, a small financial software company as a contract Flex Developer.  At the time Digital Keystone had a single client and no product, but over the next three years, while helping grow the company, I built the underlying framework and frontend to an award-winning product called Adaptive Portal. In 2015, I was offered a partnership and became Head of Frontend Development and In 2016, we sold Digital Keystone in a multi-million pound merger to Dunstan Thomas, where I stayed on as the Group Head of Frontend Engineering. The frontend framework *Adaptive Portal*, that I built for Digital Keystone was renamed to IntegroCX, and is now the largest product in the suite offered by Dunstan Thomas and what we use to deliver most of our client projects.

In 2020, as a shareholder of Dunstan Thomas, I was once again involved in a major acquisition; and Dunstan Thomas was acquired by Curtis Banks, in another multi-million pound deal, roughly 10 times larger than the Digital Keystone deal.  I continued on as the Group Head of Frontend Engineering.

## Current position

As Group Head of Frontend Engineering I still develop and add features to the frontend Integro CX framework on which the majority of our projects are built.  I also mentor and manage a team of 6 Frontend developers with the goal of building a community with resilience, as well as supporting ~20 backend developers working across various projects across the organisation. I encourage innovation and lead by example, taking the longer more complex route of enhancing the core product in a generic way to benefit current and future projects rather than custom-coding a solution for a single project.

I hold regular team meetings providing a forum for all team members to discuss their projects, pain points, big wins and anything to share, and to demonstrate features I add to the framework.  I use OKRs (Objectives Key Result) and Hackathons to encourage innovation and ring-fence developers time.  I have recently begun producing a bi-monthly PDF, *The Frontend Bulletin*, which I share with the wider company so everyone is informed what the Frontend team are working on and what new features we are adding to IntegroCX.

I work on projects for companies like CanadaLife and Aegon, big players in the UK's pension market.  Both projects were similar in that we replaced either their entire Wealth Management Platform or a large proportion of it.  Each sprint I planned the frontend work, pair programmed and guided the dev team through their frontend (and sometimes backend) tasks while also liaising with the client, ensuring that their requirements are in a dev ready state for the next sprint.

I am highly motivated and self-driven, working on internal side projects in-between my project responsibilities, some side projects are a direct result of current project needs, and others are big picture improvements for the entire product suite.  All side projects are self started, and form most of the IntegroCX key features and commercial offering.

For example, a recent side project I implemented over Xmas and into 2021, while our client offices were closed; was to completely rewrite all the CSS from the previous 6 years.  Providing a new layered skinning architecture written with performance and overriding in mind, as well as modernising the look of all new projects via a white labelling approach, built upon Neomorphism principles, which has now been adopted elsewhere in the organisation and was even the subject of a press release. https://www.dthomas.co.uk/content/fs/news/113_Neumorphism.shtml

I am also part of the sales pipeline and heavily involved in sales pitches and growing the company.  I regularly present to clients and am comfortable in delivering presentations at the appropriate technical level.  I have several slide decks prepared for prospects that I can customise just ahead of delivery, and I usually take the lead for the technical pitches. For a hackathon in 2021, I produced a sales/marketing video introducing ICX https://youtu.be/fvzzL1GTetI

### About Integro CX

Integro CX was renamed from The Adaptive Portal, which I began building while I was working for Digital Keystone.  It is a low code framework for delivering dashboard and form based single page applications, low code (on the frontend) because when I was the lone frontend developer supporting multiple projects for some years at Digital Keystone, but still valid at Dunstan Thomas where we have a smaller frontend team compared to the backend. This means the frontend is entirely configurable from JSON templates which describe dashboard layouts and what is on each form and is capable of fine control over client side validation and dynamic rules. 

Making such a configurable frontend requires a robust and flexible architecture, which I also built myself; an MVCS framework based on Knockout.js, but adding all the necessary parts such as Routing, Dependency Management/Injection, PubSub via Signals for events and messaging, and the Command Pattern for sequencing.  This enables entire systems to be prototyped and built through configuration and a bit of styling, rather than custom coding, which is reserved for new features and even those are assessed to see if they can be delivered via new configurations or features in the core framework to benefit future projects.

A case study I use in sales calls to demonstrate the power of ICX, is that I was able to build a working 12 screen prototype, based on wireframes, in less than a week.  This included custom branding, responsive, a11y compliant screens, a dashboard and multi-screen workflow, with interactive graphs and sliders and full test coverage.  Production ready, just needing a backend.

As primary architect of the IntegroCX frontend, I design and maintain an API I built from the ground up, my goal is to make using ICX as effortless as possible for the Frontend development teams that consume it.  I believe in making it so "it just works" as the developer expects.  Over the years I have learnt and refined how I do this, good API design is key, but backwards compatibility means compromises also have to be made and this is where documentation and testing really helps. So I wrote a markdown file consuming documentation system that automatically generates live interactive examples from manifest files used to describe the various components of ICX and a hash url, screenshot comparison based battery of end-to-end tests that can be invoked using a command line interface tool.


## Annual highlights

**2021**: Implemented a new skinning architecture based on Neomorphism, designing a new modern look for Integro CX paving the way forward for more beautiful future projects.

**2020**: Dunstan Thomas was acquired by Curtis Banks, selling my own shares, as the primary shareholders met their exit strategy targets.  Introduced Cypress.io based testing framework, which automatically captures and compares screenshots at different device sizes, performs a11y audits and validates performance.  Images, showing before and after screens are now included in all Pull Requests which makes visual reviews at PR time possible, as well as automated, self generating visual site maps. 

**2019**: Was instrumental in winning the **CanadaLife** project, now the largest project at Dunstan Thomas, I still lead the frontend development team for this project, reviewing each frontend Pull Request and supporting any core development needs.

**2018**: Became Group Head of Frontend Development across the whole Dunstan Thomas group of companies.  Continued to lead the frontend of the Aegon project while also building the core frontend team.

**2017**: Led the frontend development to replace the entire platform for Financial Advisers for one of the UK's largest wealth management companies, **Aegon**.  

**2016**: Was part of a multi-million pound merger, where my stock options were realised, and the primary shareholders were able to execute their exit strategies.  This happened when Dunstan Thomas acquired Digital Keystone, meeting our target valuation three years early. The Adaptive Portal also won the UK Platforms Award for best use of Platform Technology for our work with Aegon.

**2015**: Offered a partnership, and the permanent position of Head of Frontend Development in order to make Digital Keystone a more realistic proposition to sell in alignment with the founder's exit strategy.

**2014**: Designed and built the frontend of the multi award-winning Adaptive Portal, while working on client projects, primarily in financial services.  The Adaptive Portal is a framework for rendering lazy loaded Apps onto a dashboard and for rendering dynamic complex forms, either as single forms or in complex multi screen workflow (which are used quite a bit in finance).  Apps can show high level statistical summaries in the form of numbers or charts and can be expanded to drill down into more detail, typically datagrids or charts, although any Apps are possible (I built a couple of 3D apps, using three.js to render web gl 3D models, one of the Earth, complete with lens flare, and a prototype for a Health company, showing a 3D wire-frame of the human body onto which can be manipulated to show where symptoms are occurring).  Adaptive Portal also won the Platforum 'Best in show' award.

**2013**: Built the frontend of QuickPark which used an early build of the Adaptive Portal to render an SVG map showing available parking bays around various South African cities, the project was designed to work on tablets and phones.

**2012**: When Digital Keystone decided to move away from Flash as a technology I was tasked with choosing and building the frontend tech stack.  I began work on the early prototypes of the Adaptive Portal as the company strategy shifted from purely an on-site programming services company to one that builds and ships it own product, configuring that product for clients.

**2011**: Joined Digital Keystone as a contract Flex Developer to build and maintain wealth management applications for **Novia Financial** and **Aegon**.

**2010**: Worked on the **Jo Malone** website for **Estee Lauder** as a Flex developer and did a number of other Flash/Flex contracts for clients ranging from **Fisher Price** to **Drink Aware**.

**2009**: In my role as Technical Lead at Oakwood DC I headed up a team of 8 Flash Developers to deliver a £300k project for **Radica** the electronics division for **Mattel US**.  We delivered the project on time and on budget.

**2007 - 2008**: As Senior Flash Developer at Oakwood DC, I worked on a number of Flash projects for globally recognised brands such as **Barbie**, **Hotwheels**, **Disney's Cars**, **Scrabble** and **The Simpsons**.

**2006**: Worked in Australia for Publicis Mojo as a Web Developer for clients such as **Nike**, **Hertz**, **HP** and the **Victorian Government**.  A highlight was working on the **Nike Football** website for World Cup 2006 and promotions for Australia's big game against Brazil where they dared to believe that history would not repeat itself (but, it did!).

**2002 - 2005**: Graduated top of my class from De Montfort University in Leicester in 2002 with a first class degree with honours in Multimedia Computing and was also **awarded the best student prize for finishing top of my class**.  My first few years out of university I worked as a Web Developer in Reading writing ASP and ASP.NET web and windows applications and services before travelling for 20 months.


## Remote

I have been working remotely since 2012, attending a few meetings a year but otherwise working entirely from home, first in Bristol, then from Spain and now from Bath.  I have no problem with maintaining productivity and have been a disciplined self starter since University, demonstrated by graduating top of my class in 2002.

## Personal projects

Outside of work, I like to dabble in new technology and have a few side projects on the go:

### CYRUS

Cyrus is a Windows and OSX desktop app built using Electron and Vue.  It's a productivity tool and provides quick and easy access to snippets and templates which you can paste into any application.

### L M Barrett

When we moved to Spain, my wife Lorraine wrote and self-published a number of books.  I proof-read and help edit her books, design her book covers and built her website.

### PooEggCrack

PooEggCrack is a YouTube channel for my kids.  I had a lot of fun coming up with the branding (the name was Daisy's username for Roblox)  and editing their videos, filling them with Memes, sound effects and just general nonsense.  My daughter took over the channel after my first 5 videos.

## Personal life

I met my wife Lorraine while travelling in Thailand.  We have two kids, Daisy and Henry and live in Bath, having recently returned from living in Spain for 3 years, on the Costa Blanca. I enjoy spending time with my family, riding my bikes (either road or mountain) and being outdoors as much as possible.  In winters (pre-covid) we ski, and I have recently taken up wild swimming and completed my first Triathlon.

## What I am looking for

I want to take my career to the next level, becoming a partner once again and using my considerable technical skills to help grow a company and enable my fellow partners to reach their exit strategy.
